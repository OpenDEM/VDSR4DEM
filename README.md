# VDSR4DEM
Very Deep Super Resolution (VDSR) for improved resolution of Digital Elevation Models
Based on the implementation of George Seif [GitHub](https://github.com/GeorgeSeif/VDSR-Keras).
Thanks to [Zushicat](https://github.com/zushicat) for the support.

An implementation of the Super Resolution CNN proposed in:

[Kim, Jiwon, Jung Kwon Lee, and Kyoung Mu Lee. "Accurate image super-resolution using very deep convolutional networks." Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2016.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04587)

The Notebook is running on Google Colab with data storage on Google Drive. Of course this could be adapted to local resources
